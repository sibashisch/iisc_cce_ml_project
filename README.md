# Covid-19 Identification from Chest X-Ray with a corolary of Google Search correctness estimation
### This is the final project for IISC CCE - AI & ML with Python course
### Submitted by Sibashis Chatterjee (sibashis1992@gmail.com)

## Code repository
* Github: [sibashis/iisc_cce_mi_project](https://github.com/sibashisch/iisc_cce_ml_project)

## Data Collection

* Using Google image search to download Covid 19 affected Lungs' X-Ray images, refer: [image_scrapping.ipnyb](./image_scrapping.ipynb)
* Using Google Custom Search API for the scrapping. API Keys and other secrets are stored in a file ***secrets.py*** (Not pushed to remote repository for security reasons)
* The Scrapping worked till 200 images but then started returning **400 Bad Request** errors; probably I reached the free use limit.
* So had to search for alternative data sources, found some data published by some universities:
    
    * The researchers of Qatar University have compiled the COVID-QU-Ex dataset, which consists of 33,920 chest X-ray (CXR) images including: 11,956 COVID-19, 11,263 Non-COVID infections (Viral or Bacterial Pneumonia), and 10,701 Normal. This data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anasmohammedtahir/covidqu)
    * University of Montreal released images can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset/)    

* Combining all these data to create a huge labeled set of Chest X-Ray dataset. I'll select training, cross validation and test data dynamcally.

## Install packages to make workspace ready

```
pip3 install google-api-python-client
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas

## I was not able to install tensorflow using pip3 install tensorflow due to:
## ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==1.15.0 (from versions: none)
##ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow==1.15.0
## This also did not work:
## pip3 install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.14.0-py3-none-any.whl

## Hence running tensorflow on docker using colima
colima start --memory 16 --arch x86_64 
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
## Start Jupyter server with my work directory mounted
docker run -v /Users/sichatte/Downloads/iisc_cce_ml_project:/tf/iisc_cce_ml_project -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter
```
